To install packages, type into your console. Just do this once.

To use a package, load it using the `library()` function. You need to do this every time you want to use the functions in a package.

The tidyverse is a mega-package (i.e. a package of other packages) designed to make data wrangling and visualisation easier.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

is the same as...

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# An aside about RMarkdown

.pull-left[

RMarkdown documents (or .Rmd files) are key to reproducible analysis. 
- notes/explanations + "chunks" of R code 
- "knit" the document (notes + code + output) into a nice format that other people (who may not know R) can access. 

### Tricks and tips

- Insert a chunk using shortcut Alt-Cmd-I
- Hash to get levels of heading
- Asterisks to get bold and italics

The `here` package will help avoid file path drama. You can use it to tell R where you data is, relative to the top level of your project folder. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "400px"}

We can use the `read_csv()` from `readr` and `here()` to read a .csv file. 

#### Template code

```
df <- read_csv(here("data", "file.csv"))

```
<br>

> BTW you can read .xls, .sav, .sas, .stata, but you will need to install the `readxl` or `haven` packages.

# The grammar of graphics 

### ggplot wants to know 3 things
1. what data you want to plot
2. the "aesthetics" i.e. which variables you want on the x and y, what things look like (colour/shape/fill)
3. which "geom" you want to use (point, line, col, histogram, violin)

```
ggplot(data, aes(x = __, y = __)) +
  geom_point()
```
#### WATCH OUT! You can pipe data into ggplot (and combine with dplyr functions) but within ggplot you need to ADD LAYERS with +



```
data %>%
  filter(interesting_variable > z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = __, y = __)) +
  geom_point()
